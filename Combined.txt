First time hearing Windows 62 version!
cx_Freeze.common.ConfigError: cannot find file/directory named new_project <br><br>please help me sir...
Thank you very much!! Have been stucked with compiling for half of the day, trying to use pyinstaller, but it doesn&#39;t work fine for me + created exe triggers warnings about virus in it from my antivirus programm. And with cx_Freeze I&#39;ve compile a functional executable, however I have another code module imported in my Tkinter GUI and it doesn&#39;t work, but I sure I&#39;ll find a solution. Thank you again for this great video!
I tried to install that in a standalone pc but unfortunately it doesnt work.<br>It only works if you have python/pycharm on your pc.<br>What i am doing wrong?
In my win 10 system, it working superbly fine. But in windows 7, the same exe file shows api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0-dll file missing error. Please help .
Thank you very much ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§<br>Lots of love for you‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I don&#39;t know how but mine work in one go (&quot;Cx_freeze verison was 6.6&quot;) without any error. But just need to put image folder in same dir of .exe file and HURRAYY!!! xD
Thanks bro, it works very good.
good bro
Creating end user application from Python is the most insane thing I know of. People should be told that before they start to learn this language, that is &quot;well structured&quot;, &quot;intuitive&quot;, but is actually almost impossible to turn into a working final app.
sou br hello guys
Hi ,<br>I am getting this error. Module &#39;zmq&#39; has no attribute &#39;libzmq&#39;
Thanks man! U helped me a lot
i had 3 python files i want to build .exe file with pyinstaller it&#39;s crating .exe file while i open it&#39;s not doing anything but if i run that code it will working on venv . and application designed with pyqt5.
Thank you!
thank you man<br>you just made my day &lt;3
u know i have tried to convert my python file to .exe files along time age i have disapointed because my fill everytime and after that vedio i did it and learn how to solve proplesm..thnx
thank u very much u saved my life
You literally stopped me from suicide. Your space invaders video was my first intro to pygame. i made my own game and was trying to make it into exe with  no progress. But you were the one who was able to do that. you helped me with my first and last step
Thanks bro. It solved _MEI folder problem created by pyinstaller. Thanks a lot.
Hi! How to build trial version with constrain time?
Thanku you so much... it helps me alot...üëçüòÅ u r did greatü§òüòä
@buildwithpython when I click my &#39;filename.exe&#39; my window disappears immediately. I think the root.mainloop() line of code is looping through once and then stopping. Any idea why this may be happening?
Use pyinstaller
How do I fix this error? File &quot;<a href="http://setup.py/">setup.py</a>&quot;, line 9
 base = None SyntaxError: invalid syntax (There&#39;s an arrow pointing up on the e of the word base.)
Damn It Worked!!!
I am receiving error tkinter not found even though i have removed this part  &quot;excludes&quot;: [&quot;tkinter&quot;]
no forward button? wonder why...Also, once you make your .py an .exe and you want to add something to the .py, will it reflect on the .exe? or will you have to redo this whole process again?
Tysm for this amazing project...but 1 problem MP3 songs is not playing it&#39;s showing error
Bro I converted Py to exe but while double clicking module not found named tkinter error I got. Any suggestions please
how can we add permanently songs in the playlist. So that when we start our app again we can have the playlist which we have created before
Hi, it seems a bit easier with pyinstaller, can you make a small edition with it ?
Salute you man &lt;3, I never ever see any teacher like you in my life &lt;3
Man i learnt so much from you! Dhonnobad! well... the Cx_Freeze worked the first time for me... i dunno i should be happy or worried! lol!
Thanks it worked very well without any error
Is it possible for program written .py on a windows when converted to an .exe file work on a Mac OS
I&#39;m trying to build CanFestival\objdictgen\<a href="http://objdictedit.py/">objdictedit.py</a> which uses &#39;wx&#39;, there&#39;s no errors, but double-clicking the exe doesn&#39;t open the application.   How can I find what&#39;s missing?
this worked for me. I fought pyinstaller ALL DAY with no progress. This worked the first try....Thank you! lol
Your English is very good, and the tutorial was very understandable!
Hello Bhai, While installing cx_Freeze in Linux(Ubuntu) - I am getting lot of errors.
In this video you will know every thing how to convert python file into a fully working installable app like a software by which any one can install it and use your software<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS4zv4KDAagPblw0Tc8gxMBUNrv5VNJC7">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS4zv4KDAagPblw0Tc8gxMBUNrv5VNJC7</a>
Thanks. Did not get a single error.<br>It did take a lot of files and space for the smallest of programs.<br><br>Maybe there is a better way out there but at least this one works.
I cannot fix that, all the time that kind of error:<br>   error during GetDependentFiles() of &quot;C:\Users\directory......\libssl-1_1-x64.dll&quot;<br><br><br>Do you have any ideas how to fix it?

alright guys welcome back to day 29 this
is the second last day and I'm really
excited about today because we are going
to be handling a problem that a lot of
Python developers like you know just
throw up their arms - they're like I
can't do it I just can't convert a
Python file to an executable file so
what we are doing in this video is we
are converting this dot by extension to
dot exe extension which you must have
seen with a lot of software's whenever
you install a software it has dot
executable extension that is dot exe and
you don't need a python compiler to
actually run this main dot pi file so
how are you going to do that we are
gonna use a package known as CX freeze
so why are we gonna use 6 freeze is
because that's the one I know and it's
very very popular like another one is PI
to exe if you want to let me just Google
that for you so that you guys know the
other one is PI to exe you can also use
that I'm not gonna go into that I'm
gonna go into the CX freeze let me just
write that in CX freeze so I'm gonna be
using this one let's actually check out
their github page so what were you gonna
do is let me actually just read it to
you so 6 freeze setup screens for
freezing python scripts into executables
which we want it supports Python 2.7 or
higher we are using Python 3.6 now
before we actually get into it I want to
tell you that CX freeze has a lot of
problems like just like PI to XC it is a
lot of problems and we are using Python
3.6 so I'm going to go across all the
problems that you might get in Python
3.6 but let's say you are using this or
watching this video when Python maybe 4
has released or 4.5 has released so I
won't show you how actually how to like
step by step how to do it but I'm going
to show you how to create an executable
file by solving all the problems in
front of you because I'll be honest with
you I'm kind of winging this video and I
know a little bit about CX freeze and I
have an idea what to do but I'm not like
I still don't have a very concrete idea
what I'm about to do so that's why you
are going to learn how to actually solve
problems while you are
hauling a package and python on if
something gives you an error how to you
know this problem solve so the first
thing obviously we're gonna do is
install CX crease which is the most
easiest part by this time you probably
already know what we are going to do we
are going to go to the settings
interpreter click on this plus icon if
you are using anything else not PyCharm
just pip install snakes please actually
they have given the PIP install command
over here you can just use this but if
you are using pycharm you can just type
in CX and ESCO freeze and just install
this instead uh and just and just
mumbling or remembers I don't know why
anyway just click on install package and
I won't go like I want to install it
because I have already installed as you
can see CX freeze 5.1.1 and after
installing it let's check out the
documentation what the documentation has
to say about the CX underscore freeze
and how are we actually supposed to use
it so let's open this up and let's go to
using CX freeze
so it says include the six free script
which you have already installed and
then it says you can make a simple
Windows installer using a setup script
so you have to create a setup script
so let's actually check out this setup
script what it is so it says this is the
setup script so what we are going to do
is you can just read all of it but I
only read through it so what it
basically means is you have to create a
new Python file so I'm just gonna create
a new python file and you can call it
and you have to call it setup dot pi
because you can see it's written over
here set up dot pi so we can just call
it set up
dot bye press ENTER and then we can just
copy this code that they have given so
we can just copy it from here and paste
it inside a set up dot pipe
it says imports s inputs CX fries and
executable all kind of stuff and it says
to exclude quinta and not include Kinta
but we won't actually in cout include
Kinta and not exclude it so we are going
to remove this one from here let's move
this and say applications require
windows so what this basically these
three line does is that if you are using
a older version of Windows it makes sure
so this is kind of to differentiate
between the windows 62 bit version and
Windows 32 bit version if your windows
is Windows 32 bit version it kind of
changes the variable of this basically
content of this based variable you don't
need to worry about it just understand
that if your windows is of 32-bit then
it basically stores a new value inside
this based variable and then this is the
name of your application we are going to
change it to melody melody worry and
this is our zero point one version the
description is let's call it music music
player all right and executables our
main dot pipe so we are going to change
it to mean dot pi because we want this
file to be converted into an exe file
that's why we have called it mean dot pi
which is the name of a main executable
file all right so now what we have to do
is according to our instructions we have
to just invoke this script this is
Python setup dot v dot build how do you
do it in pycharm it's very easy just
open up the terminal and in terminal you
can just type in dir to check out if you
are in the right directory or not as you
can see we are in the right directory
which is my desktop and over here it's
say is main dot pipe so it's pretty easy
that basically means that we are in the
right directory and now we can just
watch this statement will say is Python
set up dot PI dot build so we are going
to try that out
setup dot pi and build and press
enter.now this won't work I already know
this won't work because it's going to
throw us some error with CX please it's
never this easy alright they're always
going to be some kind of error so now
you can see it throws us an error which
says key error TCL library so what
should I do in this kind of condition
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna copy
this and paste it on Google and see what
pops up so that's that's how you do
error handling right whenever you have
some kind of error you just kind of copy
it and paste it on Google so I'm just
gonna go to Google let's type in Google
and I'm gonna paste this okay so there
is first let's say is kierra TCL library
when I use CX please which is perfect
this is what we need and if you scroll
down it stays you can work around this
error by setting the environment
variables manually you can also do this
inside of dot pi script or another one
which i found was this one which was
working really well for me so I'm just
going to copy this one we are just gonna
import this OS first so let's copy it
over here and then I'm going to copy the
rest of the files let's copy this from
here and copy is this over here
alright so now it says after this after
this fix the executable file will be
created but we'll probably get a DLL not
found error so now what I want you to do
is I want you to just enter this command
again and press Enter
alright and then it will actually form a
exe file for you so if you go back to
your project folder there will be a
folder over here wherever you are
creating your project all right there
will be a folder over here which will be
called build and then when you go inside
it there will be an exe file and when
you double-click on it actually it will
throw an error which will say that hey
the dll not found error will be there
alright which this this basically
statement is already telling us so what
it is saying is hey just add this thing
again and it will make sure that you
don't get any errors so I'm just going
to copy this and I'm going to paste this
again
maybe somewhere where should I paste it
maybe somewhere over here pasted all
right
and now let's build our basically up
main dot by file and see if it works
spoiler alert it still probably won't
work but I am Not sure so let's just
I'll just be quiet and let it run for
some time because it might require some
time to create the executable files
alright so it has done executing and
creating our exe file so let's go back
and as you can see it has created this
folder called build if we double click
on it and then we click on this main dot
exe file and it's weight and it gives us
an error which still says import error
DLL load failed the specified model
could not be found so what is happening
over here is that it said key when the
necessary dll files will be copied
automatically which means the dll files
were not copied automatically in our
folder that's why we'll have to do it
kind of manually so what we are gonna do
is we can just go to our maybe somewhere
over here and we'll find the files that
we need so over here you can see these
two files are being copied to our
project but using this automatic import
option statement it's not being actually
copied so we need to copy both these
files so what we gonna do is we are
gonna just copy this maybe from not just
copy this we are just gonna go to our
project and this is the place where your
Python is actually installed and all the
these files of TK 8.6 exist so I just
want to go to this path so I'm just
going to copy this you can copy our own
path and don't copy mine and I'm just
gonna go to my Windows and I'm just
gonna paste this maybe I create another
window so what you can do is you can
just paste this over here somewhere and
press ENTER and so now we are inside our
DLL files so now what we want the
filenames that you want are TK 80 60 and
PCL 80 60 dot DL n so first obviously we
will go to TCL and we'll find out
that hey there are files known as TCL 80
60 and TCL it is 16 TK 2 60 . live but
these are the files not we don't want
because they have dot li b extension and
if you focus over here it says dot DLL
so we'll have to find them somewhere
else so what I did was I just went to
search and kind of entered their names
but we wanted DLL so properly you can
find them inside this DLL folder and now
we can go to P let's see and these are
the two files that we want so we can
just copy them from here and paste them
inside our melody project folder let's
paste this over here alright and now we
have these two DLL files so now we don't
need to include them over here but what
we can do is to include both of these
files we can somewhere maybe right over
here how do we include the files alright
so that let me just go to google because
we don't know how to include files
inside our CX free set up dot IO file
right so how do we include files
actually they have given it over here
you can just write this kind of a thing
and it will include files so let me just
copy this from here and in build exe
options we can just write comma and then
include files and then we are going to
just gonna put put in the file names
these two file names so the first file
name is TCL 86 it is sixty dot DLL
alright and the second file name is it t
tkt sixty okay eighty sixty dot DL uh
okay this also requires codes
alright so now is gonna include both of
these files inside our project folder
which we bought alright so now we are
gonna just do it again but before that
let me just go back and delete the build
folder that we created before so let
let's go to our melody project and
delete these this bread folder it's
gonna just delete everything so that it
doesn't kind of overwrite it shouldn't
be a problem I just don't want any
problem to happen
and now we can just dry it down Python
certified build again and let's just
wait again to make sure that it builds
properly all right so our build has
completed so let's go back to our build
and let's double click on main dot exe
and again it will give us an error if
I'm not wrong I might be wrong who knows
wait a minute what happened okay so the
bill hasn't hadn't completed yet now we
double-click on it and it gives us an
error which says images slash milli dot
ICO not defined so what has happened is
that when we compile this all of this
together these images were not compiled
inside our project so one thing that we
can do is actually move one-by-one and
write images slash and then the image
name mail it maybe melody dot ICO
and stuff because as you can see in the
Edit first it is isn't able to find
melody dot ICO and that means it won't
be even be able to find any of these
images so even if we include melody dot
ICO again then it's going to give us an
error that is not able to find mu dot
PNG or something else so what we can do
instead of writing and including
everything over here what we can do is
we can just manually just include them
inside our project so we can just copy
this and paste this over here and now if
we execute our main dot exe file this
should run properly so let's see if it
runs or not all right so now we have
successfully created our executable file
congratulations guys I think we are
pretty much done let's just once see if
it's working properly or not we are just
going to add this journey dot wave is
kind of nostalgic because you started
our project with this one small wave
file and we still have it by the end of
this lecture day on day 29 is crazy now
we can just play it
all right so our music player is working
mute button is working everything is
working properly alright guys so this is
pretty much it for day 29 and we are
done with most of the things that we
have done alright I just want to give
you a recap what we did in this video
installing CX freeze is not the
highlight of this video that is the
highlight of this video is how to handle
problems properly when you get when you
install a new package or you have some
kind of problems you just go to Google
you kind of like struck a little bit
don't give it don't give up
alright now I've told you how to use the
X freeze in Python 3.6 and it should
work in other pythons version also three
point four three point five but if it
doesn't work by any chance don't give up
and just try out something else and if
you are not able to do it just contact
me I will help you out so anyways guys
this is pretty much it for this video in
the next video we are going to be just
kind of like recapping what we have done
it because it has been a very very long
journey so I just want to recap what we
have done in the last 30 days and and I
just want to conclude with what else can
you learn in Intel and way to take your
these skills that you have learned and
how to implement them in a practical
world and just don't keep on taking
other courses or I just just don't keep
on watching other videos because this
this 30-day thing that you have done is
already enough to make sure you can
build any GUI in this world now you
won't be needing anything else if you
only use a little bit of your creative
mind and maybe used Stack Overflow a
little bit you'll be able to create
anything in this world but anyways I'm
just getting too much into it I want to
get it in the next video so yeah I'll
see you on day 30 the last day pizza
