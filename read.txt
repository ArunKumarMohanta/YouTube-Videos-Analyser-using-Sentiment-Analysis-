i use CD&#39;s and Youtube like a real metalhead.
You should never pay anyone millions for a podcast without even one view. Pay podcasts per view like the artists. If it gets ciewed, pay the podcasters, if not, then not. And the free service offers too much. Plus you cant view just the big album cover and nothing else while listening to a song.
i use Deezer for few years now, and i gotta say im quite happy with it for 5 bucks a month, initially their apps were not so good but over the years their mobile and PC App runs quite well and UI looks cool... apple music costs 6,50 in my country and i got iphone and mac so id like to try apple music but only if i can transfer my current playlists from deezer , idk how can it be achieved i heard about some apps that provides this services, also on Deezer i can setup to play in 1411 kbps FLAC on wifi and cellular but only when high speed internet is available
Great video but I&#39;m surprised there were no mentions of tidal, Deezer or Soundcloud
Downloading will always be better than streaming
I still prefer Spotify over Apple Music
Spotify is trash bro why so many ppl use trash? Come on yt music is the present and the future
The Meghan Markle podcast investment was a dud.
i like spotify....cause i can use it for free.
stopped using Spotify about a year ago<br>ever since i got YouTube premium, been using yt music since then
I&#39;ve enjoyed their premium membership
I love my Spotify Premium
very informative!
Youtube music as a much better algorithm.  Migrated my family account to yt music. Amazing
Why is my algorithm trying to make my mind to another streaming service? I love Spotify üíÄ
I really want to enjoy podcasts in Spotify, but they are audio only. I have to do it in YouTube as they are the only ones where all are videos
The only reason I ever used spotify was that it works in a web browser.<br>&quot;was&quot; because they (most likely willfully) introduced a memory leak. Be prepared for your web player to crash after it swallows 5GB more memory than it should.
Apple Music is the best now. Spotify used to be better. But now Apple Music is better. Apple music also has an android app unlike other Apple apps.
Youtube music is good tbh
I still do not understend the problem with rising of subsccription price, after the change a lot of people will keep their subscriptions, they are got used to the spotify and will not want to change to other music app, a lot of android users will probably could to choose only between YouTube and Spotify.<br><br>and still the main thing about subscription price hike:<br>If they will loose fx. 20% of users after the increase in price the number of plays will decrease also on something like 20% and they will have to pay 20% less in total to the artist, so, the revenue decreaces lesss then costs since now each member pay more and there is a chance for profit.<br><br>Of course company of this size should consider consiquences of their steps since change in market of music can make some artist poor just in one day or something else could happend.<br>But they still have billions of Dollars, they can perform huge surveys to analyse the problem and they really know why they cant do it. So problem of price hike for subscribtion is not exactly in leaving users, but in something else.
I moved to YouTube premium instead.
I moved to Apple Music some time back. The audio quality is unmatched. I do think that what is happening to Spotify is unfair.
Isn&#39;t it great how everything is owned by massive greedy corporations these days?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkSmUTK2FlY&amp;t=323">5:23</a> uhm and YT Music is from Google so Spotify is the only one that can‚Äôt just loose money
It&#39;s a two way race let&#39;s be real
spotify is screwed. every other player can afford to take losses to push other services, while they have nothing. they can&#39;t raise prices because the other players are hungry for market share and will keep their prices lower for months or maybe a year after spotify raises. their forays into audiobooks and podcasts are too niche to generate any signifigant revenue or profit. their other ventures into merch, tours etc, also don&#39;t make much money. they have no cash pile to make major moves with. investors are doubting their whole business model. they are just strapped in every possible way. they can&#39;t do hifi because every other player offers it for free and spotify would just lose more money offering it and charging for it is a terrible look. Usually with most companies you can identify some opportunity, but with spotify I have no faith they can turn it around. they just don&#39;t have the resources or infrastructure to do anything.
lol
idk man i smell tax fraud
Lol failing? They have 243 million paid subscribers compared to Apple 93 million
me using mp3 for every song i listen to
If there was a way to transfer all my liked songs to Apple Music I‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat.
Spotify is still the best
Spotify is ass cuz it offers a clunky UI. At least that&#39;s why I left it
spotifys useless unless your on premium
This is such a well put together video, I couldn‚Äôt believe the sub count. Keep it up, you earned a new fan.
Given what I get with Spotify for the price, music, podcasts, books, the price is so worth it. And so far for me I‚Äôve discovered so much new music especially with discover weekly. Sometimes you just gotta find a good playlist to find new music. Idk
Another reason is Spotify is independent, they only have one source of income. YouTube Music and Apple Music can afford to lose money sonce the parent company has other forms of making money
I&#39;ve never heard of tencent music
Bro I&#39;ve been using Spotify for over 10 years. I have Apple, Amazon, and YouTube music. Spotify interface is so much easier to use and find playlists.
When you owe the bank $100,000 it‚Äôs your problem. <br>When you owe the bank $500,000,000 it‚Äôs the banks problem.
If Spotify would allow me to actually discover new music rather than just recommend me the same songs I&#39;ve been listening to, it&#39;d be actually useful. Getting personalized playlists for &#39;moods&#39; was a great step but it&#39;s already stagnated. I&#39;m so close to switching to Apple Music because I can&#39;t be bothered to discover new music elsewhere only to save it to Spotify
I use Spotify sometimes when I listen to lofi beats while working, and after doing this for a long time, absolutely ALL my playlists got filled with this shit that I can‚Äôt get rid of. I tried disliking the songs, but still, there‚Äôs always a few left, offering me to listen to these beats.
Spotify Podcasts UI is dogshit
I feel guilty for using mod apk now üíÄ
‚Äúyou can listen to any song you want with either service‚Äù no I can‚Äôt, for most songs I listen to I have to use bandcamp and soundcloud my dude.
I use Apple Music and sometime give a chance spotify.... Apple is better, design,algoritms and so on
It‚Äôs only a matter of time before Spotify are bought by a bigger multinational. What‚Äôs your money on? Meta? Elon Musk? Microsoft?
I switched to YT Premium. I now pay exactly the same as before, but get YT ad free plus all the music on YT Music plus all podcasts integrated into YT Music, even those that are hosted on YouTube instead of an RSS Feed, including optional video. It‚Äôs far superior than what Spotify gets me and made YT on mobile devices usable again.
Lmao this sounds like spotify propaganda
can you do a video about what happened to Pandora?
As I am YouTube Premium user, I try to replace Spotify by YouTube Music. I tried it twice. but: the UI of YTM is UTTER GARBAGE. Even after more than three weeks I couldn&#39;t handle. plus: it keeps flooding my playlists with user-uploaded music in crap quality. I rather pay the 15 quid a month for spotify instead of useing youtube music for free...
I see Apple or Google buying Spotify within the next 5 years for sure. More so Apple
Apple Music &gt; Spotify
Youtube Music has 0 video ads and EVERY SONG EVERY UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE EVER
I can‚Äôt believe they thought Podcasts would be the ticket to profitability. Podcasts are already in such a saturated market, you can listen to them on any number of apps. I think the only viable option is to increase the subscription price but they‚Äôve got to find a way to set themselves apart from the competition to justify it.
So what you‚Äôre saying is it‚Äôs the record companies who are screwing the artists
Losing a couple hundred million while make 13 billion is nothing to be worried about lol Spotify is doing just fine if those numbers are accurate
0.3 cents is way more than what they pay lol, it&#39;s somewhere around 0.003 to 0.005, a lot of artists are now independent and they still pay them that much even tho there is no labels to pay royalties to
Youtube music app for windows, sucks big time. And the IOS/Android version also. You cant even search inside the playlists, lame.
Bothy the spotify royalties you qote (way too high) and the &quot;fact&quot; that all music streaming services have the same catalogue if songs is blatantly false. Do your research next time.
If I didn&#39;t have such a big playlist and pay $5 a month bc the vpn method I&#39;d switch to apple music so quick
Started listening to German language studies on spotify, glad I don&#39;t have to download ANOTHER app, i&#39;m glad they did podcasts
I mean, they can try to coordinate with their competitors to all together reduce the royalties all of them pay to the big 3. <br>It‚Äôs a win for all competitors in the space and solves the core problem. <br>What will the big 3 do? Pull out from all music streaming options? To that I say good luck.
The second apple releases a solid windows app im switching back to
Spotify could play songs like Pandora does with smooth, almost seamless transitions between songs. I believe this would make subscribers think twice before unsubscribing due to a satisfying listening experience.
Youtube Music absolutely slams Spotify
I get Apple Music for free and still pay for Spotify. Would be sad to see them ever go out of business.
With the low payout per stream Spotify has, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible that such a high proportion of their revenue goes to payouts. I feel like you skipped over the free user part, where they must be taking massive revenue loss for the numbers to make sense
Apple music ‚ù§
Youtube is the most worth it imo. Yt premium and yt music in 1 subscription?
YouTube Music is the Best üíØüíØüòéüòé even Sounds clearer than Spotify<br>Apple music has the Highest Quality.. Spotify sound quality is like MP3 LOL ü§£ü§£
One way they could prevent customers from leaving is by having a better app than everyone else, but they&#39;re barely accomplishing this these days..
I&#39;m just gonna buy the music I like and be done with spotify.
Excellent video.  With Gala Music growing,  Spotify&#39;s problem just got bigger.
The only thing stopping me is because I‚Äôve been using Spotify since its launch and idk how I‚Äôd move all my playlists over
I&#39;m shocked a higher percentage of their user base aren&#39;t premium users, the free version of Spotify is unusable if you listen to music for more than a few minutes a day.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkSmUTK2FlY&amp;t=295">4:55</a> it‚Äôs not true what you said. I can‚Äôt listen to the same music on Spotify and other streaming services. Maybe you are American and that‚Äôs true there. But me as Eastern European myself (I live in Poland) when I tried free trial of Apple Music after AirPods purchase, I just couldn‚Äôt find numerous of songs of local artists. On Spotify I listened to a small garage black metal band from my city, or folk polish music my parents use to listen to at my age. In fact I loved Apple Music with all apple ecosystem and features it has, but I reverted to Spotify, because it‚Äôs just more, more useful in country i live in
It&#39;s hands down the best music streaming service but I have a feeling it can&#39;t sustain itself for much long in the current climate. The competition has huge conglomerates backing up their losses and Spotify has nothing to lean on.
I stopped my spotify subscription as soon as they signed up that right-wing anti-vaxxer nut Joe Rogen. I am not going to support a company that pays money going to that to right-wing traitors that spread misinformation.

I used to have Spotify premium and since yesterday I have free but it sucks so much üò¢ I didn‚Äôt thought it would be so different so now I‚Äôm gonna look for other options this vid helped a lot
bull shit spotify robs artists

At least Apple Music has a proper music library. Can save songs and sort by song album artist etc. Spotify is by playlist. YouTube  music drives me nuts as in order to save a song I have to like it and it goes to my like playlist on YouTube something I want my fav songs to be off YouTube and only in YouTube music.
Its downhill for spotify
YouTube Music is the best.
Odd that &quot;cutting costs&quot; isn&#39;t mentioned as an option. I mean how do they spend that much on development?!
I prefer Apple Music, but the song ‚ÄûMegamix‚Äú by Masterboy is not available in Germany. Spotify, Deezer or YouTube Music have it.
What Spotify did wrong was give non premium users unlimited control and then abruptly limit them when funds dried. Like not allowing them to seek through the song or read the lyrics tends to irritate the userbase. Ig the last straw was the feature where they added random songs to the users playlists. This caused a drop in users who would&#39;ve gladly listened to the ads for uninterrupted playtime. Now they have a lesser audience to advertise to.
YT Music gives good suggestions.
Sell to Google?
Unless you have one of the aformentioned bundles already, spotify is no doubt the best choice. Even if you like the other UIs (which mostly people don&#39;t), the playlists by either the already established community or Spotify themselves are just better
We should hope spotify remains the best product out of these, because giving Apple, Google or Amazon more power would suck.
Because they&#39;ve got Joe Rogan and he&#39;s got hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to produce podcasts on Spotify and they would rather pay Joe Rogan than actually pay artists to put music up there. The small artist like myself get nothing whilst the biggest of the biggest of the biggest artist that assigned to the biggest record companies are the only ones that get the actual dough if you know what I mean.
The biggest problem with Apple Music (for me) is playing a song from a device to another device seamlessly using the &quot;Select another device&quot; function, if Apple Music have that, I would switch to it as I have an iPhone and MacBook...
YouTube Music is definitely my go to. I love the fact I can add songs to playlists that only exist via user upload on youtube. It means I can add some really specific indie covers to playlists and that is just a game changer to me

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkSmUTK2FlY&amp;t=290">4:50</a> Not entirely true. I&#39;ve found tons of albums that are only available on one service or another.
